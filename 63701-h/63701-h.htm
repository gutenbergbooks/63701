<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>This book was originally published in 1643. The reprinted edition
of 1827 retained the errors and misspellings of the original book,
and this etext has made only a few minor changes to the English text,
which are noted at <a href="#TN">the end of the book</a>. No changes have been made to
accents or (mis)spelling of the native American words.</p>

<p>Punctuation in the two-column dictionary tables has been made more
consistent; missing commas or periods have been silently added to the
end of table entries. Inconsistent use of question marks has been
left unchanged.</p>

<p>Footnote anchors are denoted by <span class="fnanchor">[number]</span>, and the two footnotes have
been placed at the end of the ‘<a href="#SKETCH">Sketch of the Life of Roger Williams</a>’.</p>

<p>The <a href="#TABLE">Table of Contents</a> can be found at the back of the book, the same
placement as in the original book.</p>

<p class="p2">In presenting to the public the first volume of the Collections
of the Rhode-Island Historical Society, some account
of the rise and progress of the Society may not be
deemed inappropriate. It may vindicate the society from the
charge of remissness in performing the duties it has assumed,
and at the same time, remove some of the prejudices which
it has had to encounter.</p>

<p>There have not been wanting, at any time, individuals
who have been anxious that the history of this State, and
the deeds and sufferings and opinions of the first settlers,
should not be handed down to posterity by tradition alone,
or that future generations should learn them from the erroneous
and imperfect statements of prejudiced historians.</p>

<p>Much was effected by these individuals in collecting together
the scattered fragments and perishing memorials of
our early history. But the field was too large and the labor
too great to be compassed by the exertions of any individuals,
however ardent their zeal. And besides this, many persons
who held highly valuable documents, received in most
instances from their ancestors, were unwilling to part with
them until a secure place of deposite was provided, under the
authority of a regularly organized association.</p>

<p>These feelings, aided by various concomitant circumstances,
gave rise to the Rhode-Island Historical Society, in the year
1822. In the summer of the same year, a charter of incorporation
was obtained, and in July the Society was organized.
Since that time, unremitting exertions have been made in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
effecting its objects, and many valuable documents, both
printed and manuscript have been collected. The number
of resident members is at present about fifty.</p>

<p>The subject of publishing a Series of Collections was agitated
soon after the establishment of the Society. Various
circumstances served to retard this project until <span class="smcap">Zachariah
Allen</span>, Esq. a member, presented to the Society a manuscript
copy of Roger Williams’ Key to the Indian Language
which he had procured from the printed copy in the Bodliean
Library at Oxford. This manuscript has since been carefully
compared with the printed copy of the same work, in the possession
of the Massachusetts Historical Society. At this
time, when philosophers are engaged in searching for the
origin, and philanthropists, in meliorating the condition, of the
aborigines, it was thought by the Society that the publication
of this curious and valuable relick of the venerable
founder of the State would be particularly acceptable and
appropriate; and in the hope that both pleasure and profit
may be derived from its perusal, it is now respectfully commended
to the attention and favor of the public.</p>

<span class="fs135 bold">ROGER WILLIAMS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Roger Williams was born of reputable parents,
in Wales, A. D. 1598. He was educated at the
University of Oxford; was regularly admitted to orders
in the Church of England, and preached for
some time, as a Minister of that Church; but on embracing
the doctrines of the Puritans, he rendered
himself obnoxious to the laws against non-conformists
and embarked for America, where he arrived
with his wife, whose name was Mary, on the 5th
of February, 1631. In April following, he was called
by the Church of Salem, as teaching Elder, under
their then Pastor, Mr. Skelton. This proceeding
gave offence to the Governor and Assistants of the
Massachusetts Bay, and in a short time, he removed
to Plymouth, and was engaged as assistant to Mr.
Ralph Smith, the pastor of the Church at that place.
Here he remained until he found that his views of
religious toleration and strict non-conformity gave offence
to some of his hearers, when he returned again
to Salem, and was settled there, after Mr. Skelton’s
death in 1634. While here and while at Plymouth, he
maintained the character he had acquired in England,
that “of a godly man and a zealous preacher.”
He appears, however, to have been viewed by the
government of that colony with jealousy from his first
entrance into it. He publicly preached against the
patent from the king, under which they held their
lands, on the ground that the king could not dispose
of the lands of the Natives without their consent&mdash;he
reprobated “the calling of <em>natural</em> men to the exercise
of those holy ordinances of prayers, oaths,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
&amp;c.” and “the frequenting of Parish Churches, under
the pretence of hearing some ministers;”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but that,
without doubt, which rendered him most obnoxious,
was his insisting that the magistrate had no right to
punish for breaches of the first table; or in other
words, “to deal in matters of conscience and religion.”
These causes conspiring with others of less importance,
finally procured a decree of banishment to
be passed against him, in the autumn of 1635, and he
was ordered to depart the jurisdiction, in six weeks.
Subsequently to this, he was permitted to remain until
spring, on condition that he did not attempt to draw
any others to his opinions; but “the people being
much taken with the apprehension of his godliness,”
in the January following the Governor and Assistants
sent an officer to apprehend him and carry him on
board a vessel then lying at Nantasket, bound to England.
But before the officer arrived, he had removed
and gone to Rehoboth. Being informed by Governor
Winslow of Plymouth, that he was then within
the bounds of the Plymouth patent, in the spring
he crossed the river, and commenced the settlement
of Providence. The field that he first planted composes
“Whatcheer,” the present residence of his
Excellency, James Fenner, Governor of Rhode-Island,
and the land originally set off to Williams adjoining
this field, has continued to the present day,
in possession of his descendants.</p>

<p>He afterwards embraced some of the leading opinions
of the Baptists, and in March 1639, was baptized
by immersion, at Providence, by Ezekiel Holliman,
whom he afterwards baptized. He formed a Society
of this order, and continued preaching to them for several
months, and then separated from them, doubting,
it is said, the validity of all baptism, because a
direct succession could not be traced from the Apostles
to the officiating ministers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>In 1643, Williams went to England as agent for the
colonies at Providence, Rhode Island, and Warwick,
to solicit a charter of incorporation, which he finally
procured, signed by the Earl of Warwick, then Governor
and Admiral of the English plantations, and by
his Council&mdash;bearing date March 14, 1644. On the
17th of September, 1644, he returned from England
and landed at Boston, bringing a letter of recommendation
to the Governor and Assistants of the Massachusetts
Bay, from some of the most influential members of
the Long Parliament. This saved him from the penalty
incurred by him on entering their bounds, which
he avoided at his departure, by taking ship at New-York.
In 1651, serious difficulties having been raised
in the colony, by Coddington’s procuring a Charter,
which gave him almost unlimited authority over
the Islands of Narragansett Bay, Williams and
Clarke were despatched as agents of the colony,
to procure a revocation of it. This they effected
in October 1652. Williams returned in 1654, but
Clarke remained in England, and procured the second
Charter of 1663. While in England at this time
Williams resided a principal part of the time, at Belleau,
a seat of Sir Henry Vane, in Lincolnshire; and
on his return, brought a letter from him, recorded in
the records of Providence, inviting the planters to a
closer union with one another. This letter, aided by
the urgent and constant solicitations of Williams,
finally restored peace and union to the colony, which,
during his absence, had been rent by many divisions.
He was several times both before and after
this period, elected to the office of President or
Governor of this colony, by the “free vote of the freemen.”
He died in April, 1683, at Providence, and
was buried under arms, in his family burying ground,
with every testimony of respect that the colony could
manifest. He was the father of six children: viz.
Mary, Freeborn, Providence, Mercy, Daniel, and
Joseph; the descendants of whom, at this time,
amount to several thousands.</p>

<p>Very few incidents in his life, are to be collected
from the writings of Williams, and the prejudices of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
contemporary and even later historians who have
mentioned him, render it difficult to form a true estimate
of his character. Facts, which in the estimation
of the writers of those days, would have raised a more
orthodox man almost above the level of humanity, are
slightly mentioned; and opinions which all protestant
nations and even the descendants of his enemies have
since fully adopted, in him were heretical and subversive,
not only of church but of civil government.
From these slight and prejudiced statements must the
character of Williams be drawn. They prove him to
have been a man of unblemished moral character and
of ardent piety, unyielding in opinions which he conceived
to be right, and not to be diverted from what
he believed to be duty, either by threats or by flattery.</p>

<p>One fact speaks volumes in favor of his Christian
temper. After he was banished, he conceived himself
to be an injured, persecuted man, but with all the
opportunities which his intimacy with the neighboring
Indians gave him, no purpose of revenge seems ever
to have been harbored by him. Instead of that, the
next year after his banishment, he gave to his very
persecutors, information of the Indian plot, which
would have destroyed their whole settlement. He
<ins class="corr" id="tn-12" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'concluded treates'">
concluded treaties</ins> for them, which ensured their peace
and prosperity, “employing himself continually in
acts of kindness to his persecutors, affording relief
to the distressed, offering an asylum to the persecuted”</p>

<p>He is accused, and not unjustly, of frequent changes
in his religious sentiments. These changes must have
been the effect of sincere conviction&mdash;they could not
have arisen from a time-serving policy. For had he
remained an Episcopalian, England and all her comforts,
and undoubtedly as due to his Learning, some
of the honors of the Church were before him; and
had he continued a lukewarm non-conformist, Massachusetts
and Plymouth, the society of his former
friends and especially that of Hooker and Cotton, might
have solaced him in his residence in this new country.
But these were all resigned for what he conceived
to be his duty to his God. He was however<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
at all times and under all changes, the undaunted
champion of Religious Freedom. It was openly professed
by him, on his arrival among those who sought
in America, a refuge from persecution and strange as
it may seem, it was probably the first thing that excited
the prejudices of the Massachusetts and Plymouth
rulers against him. He was accused of carrying this
favorite doctrine so far as to exempt from punishment
any criminal who pleaded conscience. But let his
own words exculpate him from this charge.</p>

<p>“That ever I should speak or write a tittle that
tends to such an infinite liberty of conscience, is a
mistake, and which I have ever disclaimed and abhorred.
To prevent such mistakes, I at present shall
only propose this case. There goes many a ship to
sea with many hundred souls in one ship, whose weal
and woe is common; and is a true picture of a common-wealth,
or an human combination or society. It
hath fallen out, some times, that both Papists and Protestants,
Jews and Turks, may be embarked into one
ship. Upon which supposal, I affirm that all the
liberty of conscience, that ever I pleaded for, turns
upon these two hinges, That none of the Papists, Protestants,
Jews or Turks, be forced to come to the ship’s
prayers or worship; nor compelled from their own particular
prayers or worship, if they practice any. I
further add, that I never denied, that notwithstanding
this liberty, the commander of this ship ought to command
the ship’s course; yea, and also command that
justice, peace and sobriety be kept and practiced, both
among the seamen and all the passengers. If any of
the seamen refuse to perform their service, or passengers
to pay their freight; if any refuse to help in
person or purse, toward the common charges or defence;
if any refuse to obey the common laws and
orders of the ship concerning their common peace
or preservation; if any shall mutiny and rise up
against their commanders and officers; if any should
preach or write, that there ought to be no commanders
nor officers, because all are equal in Christ,
therefore no masters nor officers, no laws nor orders,
no corrections nor punishments; I say, I never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
denied but in such cases, whatever is pretended, the
commander or commanders may judge, resist, compel
and punish such transgressors, according to their
deserts and merits.”</p>

<p>And in Williams’ political transactions, self interest
does not appear to have had any influence, in
opposition to the public good. The title to Providence
Plantations, from the Indians, was in him and in
him alone, by their deed. Yet almost his first act was
to divide it among his “loving neighbors” reserving
to himself only an equal right with them. In the charter
procured by him, no office of trust or profit was
conferred on him. Of what other agent employed on
such business, can the same be said? Well might
Calender call him, “the most disinterested man that
ever lived.”</p>

<p>The publications of Williams, that have reached us,
are not voluminous. The public services in which
he was engaged, and the private difficulties which he
had to encounter, undoubtedly prevented them from
being so. The first, in order of time, is his “Key
to the Language of America,” now republished.
This, it would seem, was composed during his voyage
to England in 1643, and was printed at London
soon after his arrival. It preceded Elliot’s publications
on the same subject, and was highly commended
by the Board of Trade, at the time it was published.
Very few copies of the original edition are now
extant. The one belonging to the Massachusetts
Historical Society is the only one known to be in this
country. A strain of ardent piety runs through this
work which cannot fail to recommend both itself
and its author to the reader. It presents the character
of the Natives in a new and favorable light, and appears
to have been admirably calculated to facilitate
that intercouse with them, which the safety of the settlers
and the interests of both settlers and natives imperiously
demanded.</p>

<p>The next work was his “Bloody Tenent,” written
in answer to Cotton’s work upholding the right
and enforcing the duty of the civil magistrate to regulate
the doctrines of the Church. This work called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
forth a reply from Cotton, entitled “The Bloody
Tenent, Washed and made White in the blood of the
Lambe.” And this was followed by a rejoinder from
Williams, entitled “The Bloody Tenent yet more
Bloody, by Mr. Cotton’s endeavor to Wash it White.”
In these works of Williams the doctrine of religious liberty
and unlimited toleration are illustrated in strong
language and supported by stronger arguments&mdash;arguments
that preceded those of Locke, Bayle and Furneau.
The character and standing of Cotton made him
an antagonist, with whom to contend, was glorious,
even though vanquished, but with truth on his side, and
supported and strengthened by a sense of it, Williams
entered the contest, and was not vanquished. Accompanying
this last, are two letters, one to Gov. Endicott
and the other to the Clergy of Great-Britain
and Ireland. The first of which, if it had been
read with the spirit in which it appears to have been
written, would have stayed the arm of Persecution in
New-England. These were published in London in
1652. About twenty years after, Williams had a
controversy with the Quakers. He maintained a
public dispute with them at Newport, on the 9th, 10th
and 12th, and at Providence, on the 17th August,
1672. Afterwards he published his “George Fox
digged out of his Burrows,” in answer to a work of
Fox. This is a rare book.</p>

<p>In regard to the literary attainments of Roger
Williams it is deemed proper to say but little. The
readers of this work will be principally such as
chuse to form their <em>own</em> opinions. It will be, however,
generally admitted, that his Style, abounds
with the Beauties and Defects, peculiar to the Literature
of his own Times. It is no small praise to say
of him, that, as an author, he compares well with his
great opponent, <span class="smcap">Cotton</span>. Both indulge in the same
apposite, but somewhat profuse use of Scripture
allusion and Phraseology; both are at home in the
Classics and the Fathers, and surprise us with quaint
erudition; both fight with the same weapon of controversy&mdash;the
ancient scholastic Logic.</p>

<p>Those who have a partiality for Williams will justify<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
that partiality, by the conciliating liberality of his
doctrines, and the philosophic philanthropy of his
sentiments, which impart a peculiar amenity to his
diction, and to his reasoning, an air of common sense
deduction and equitable and rational conclusion,
more satisfactory than the most refined subtilties of
dialectic skill.</p>

<p>No description of the person of Williams has reached
us, but Rhode-Islanders will always remember
his name and his deeds, and revere him as the
father of their State, and the world will ever regard
him as the earliest and boldest champion of the
right of all men “fully to have and enjoy their own
judgments and consciences, in matters of religious
concernments.”</p>

</div>


<p class="p3">I present you with a Key; I have not heard of
the like, yet framed, since it pleased God to bring
that mighty continent of America to light: others of
my Countreymen, have often and excellently, and
lately written of the Countrey (and none that I know
beyond the goodnesse and worth of it.)</p>

<p>This Key, respects the native language of it, and
happily may unlocke some Rarities concerning the
natives themselves, not yet discovered.</p>

<p>I drew the materialls in a rude lumpe at Sea, as a
private helpe to my owne memory, that I might not
by my present absence lightly lose what I had so
dearely bought in some few yeares hardship and
charges among the Barbarians; yet being reminded
by some, what pitie it were to bury those Materialls
in my Grave at land or sea; and withall, remembring
how oft I have been importun’d by worthy friends of
all sorts, to afford them some helps this way.</p>

<p>I resolved (by the assistance of the most High) to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
cast those Materials into this Key, pleasant and profitable
for All, but specially for my friends residing in
those parts:</p>

<p>A little Key may open a Box, where lies a bunch
of Keyes.</p>

<p>With this I have entred into the secrets of those
Countries, where ever English dwel about two hundred
miles, betweene the French and Dutch Plantations;
for want of this, I know what grosse mistakes
my selfe and others have run into.</p>

<p>There is a mixture of this Language North and
South, from the place of my abode, about six hundred
miles; yet within the two hundred miles (aforementioned)
their Dialects doe exceedingly differ; yet not
so, but (within that compasse) a man may by this
helpe, converse with thousands of Natives all over
the Countrey: and by such converse it may please
the Father of Mercies to spread civilitie (and in his
owne most holy season) Christianitie; for one Candle
will light ten thousand, and it may please God to
blesse a little Leaven to season the mightie lump of
those Peoples and Territories.</p>

<p>It is expected, that having had so much converse
with these Natives, I should write some little of
them.</p>

<p>Concerning them (a little to gratifie expectation) I
shall touch upon foure Heads:</p>

<p>First, by what Names they are distinguished.</p>

<p>Secondly, Their Originall and Descent.</p>

<p>Thirdly, their Religion, Manners, Customes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Fourthly, That great Point of their Conversion.</p>

<p>To the first, their Names are of two Sorts:</p>

<p>First, those of the English giving: as <ins class="corr" id="tn-18" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Natives, Salvages'">
Natives, Savages</ins>, Indians, Wild-men, (so the Dutch call<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
them Wilden) Abergeny men, Pagans, Barbarians,
Heathen.</p>

<p>Secondly, their names, which they give themselves.</p>

<p>I cannot observe, that they ever had (before the
comming of the English, French, or Dutch amongst
them) any Names to difference themselves from
strangers, for they knew none; but two sorts of names
they had, and have amongst themselves.</p>

<p>First, generall, belonging to all Natives, as Nínnuock,
Ninnimissinûwock, Eniskeetompaûwog, which
signifies Men, Folke or People.</p>

<p>Secondly, particular names, peculiar to severall
Nations of them amongst themselves, as Nanhigganêuck,
Massachusêuck, Cawasumséuck, Cowwesêuck,
Quintikóock, Quinnipiéuck, Pequttóog, &amp;c.</p>

<p>They have often asked mee, why wee call them
Indians, Natives, &amp;c. and understanding the reason,
they will <ins class="corr" id="tn-19" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'call themselues'">
call themselves</ins> Indians in opposition to
English &amp;c.</p>

<p>For the second Head proposed, their Originall and
Descent.</p>

<p>From Adam and Noah that they spring, it is granted
on all hands.</p>

<p>But for their later Descent and whence they came
into those parts, it seemes as hard to finde, as to
finde the well head of some fresh Streame, which
running many miles out of the Countrey to the salt
Ocean, hath met with many mixing Streames by the
way. They say themselves, that they have sprung
and growne up in that very place, like the very trees
of the wildernesse.</p>

<p>They say that their Great God Cowtantowwit created
those parts, as I observed in the Chapter of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Religion. They have no Clothes, Bookes, nor Letters,
and conceive their Fathers never had; and
therefore they are easily perswaded that the God that
made Englishmen is a greater God, because Hee
hath so richly endowed the English above themselves:
But when they heare that about sixteen hundred
yeeres agoe, England and the Inhabitants thereof
were like unto themselves, and since have received
from God, Clothes, Bookes, &amp;c. they are greatly
affected with a secret hope concerning themselves.</p>

<p>Wise and judicious men with whom I have discoursed,
maintaine their originall to be Northward
from Tartaria: and at my now taking ship, at the
Dutch Plantation, it pleased the Dutch Governour
(in some discourse with mee about the natives) to
draw their Line from Iceland, because the name
Sackmakan (the name for an Indian Prince, about
the Dutch) is the name for a Prince in Iceland.</p>

<p>Other opinions I could number up: under favour
I shall present (not mine opinion, but) my observations
to the judgement of the wise.</p>

<p>First, others (and myselfe) have conceived some
of their words to hold affinitie with the Hebrew.</p>

<p>Secondly, they constantly anoint their heads as the
Jewes did.</p>

<p>Thirdly, they give Dowries for their wives as the
Jewes did.</p>

<p>Fourthly (and which I have not so observed amongst
other nations as amongst the Jewes, and these) they
constantly seperate their women (during the time of
their monthly sicknesse) in a little house alone by
themselves foure or five dayes, and hold it an Irreligious
thing for either Father or Husband or any
Male to come neere them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>They have often asked me if it bee so with women
of other nations, and whether they are so separated:
and for their practice they plead Nature and Tradition.
Yet againe I have found a greater affinity of
their language with the Greek tongue.</p>

<p>2. As the Greekes and other nations, and our
selves call the seven starres (or Charles Waine,
the beare,) so doe they Mosk, or Paukunnawaw the
beare.</p>

<p>3. They have many strange Relations of one
Wétucks, a man that wrought great Miracles amongst
them, and walking upon the waters, &amp;c. with some
kind of broken resemblance to the Sonne of God.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is famous that the Sowwest (Sowaniu) is
the great subject of their discourse. From thence
their Traditions. There they say (at the South west)
is the Court of their Great God Cautántouwit: at the
South-west are their forefathers soules: to the South
west they goe themselves when they dye; From the
South west came their Corne, and Beanes out of their
great God Cautántowwits field: and indeed the further
Northward and Westward from us their Corne
will not grow, but to the Southward better and better.
I dare not conjecture in these Vncertainties, I believe
they are lost, and yet hope (in the Lords holy season)
some of the wildest of them shall be found to share in
the blood of the Son of God. To the third head, concerning
their Religion, Customes, Manners &amp;c. I
shall here say nothing, because in those 32 chapters
of the whole book, I have briefly touched those of all
sorts, from their birth to their burialls, and have endeavoured
(as the nature of the worke would give
way) to bring some short observations and applications
home to Europe from America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>Therefore fourthly, to that great point of their conversion
so much to bee longed for, and by all New-English
so much pretended, and I hope in Truth.</p>

<p>For my selfe I have uprightly laboured to suite my
endeavours to my pretences: and of later times (out
of desire to attaine their Language) I have run through
varieties of Intercourses with them Day and Night,
Summer and Winter, by Land and Sea, particular
passages tending to this, I have related divers, in the
Chapter of their Religion.</p>

<p>Many solemne discourses I have had with all sorts
of nations of them, from one end of the Countrey to
another (so farre as opportunity, and the little language
I have could reach.)</p>

<p>I know there is no small preparations in the hearts
of multitudes of them. I know their many solemne
confesions to my self, and one to another of their lost
wandring conditions.</p>

<p>I know strong Convictions upon the Consciences
of many of them, and their desires uttred that way.</p>

<p>I know not with how little Knowledge and Grace of
Christ the Lord may save, and therefore neither will
despair or report much.</p>

<p>But since it hath pleased some of my worthy Countrymen
to mention (of late in print) Wequash, the
Pequt Captaine, I shall be bold so farre to second
their relations, as to relate mine own hopes of him
(though I dare not be so confident as others.)</p>

<p>Two dayes before his death, as I past up to Quinnihticut
River it pleased my worthy friend Mr. Fenwick
whom I visited at his house in Say-Brook Fort
at the mouth of that River, to tell me that my old
friend Wequash lay very sick: I desired to see him,
and Himselfe was pleased to be my Guide two mile
where Wequash lay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>Amongst other discourse concerning his sicknesse
and Death (in which hee freely bequeathed his son to
Mr. Fenwick) I closed with him concerning his Soule:
Hee told me that some two or three yeare before he
had lodged at my House, where I acquainted him with
the Condition of all mankind, and his own in particular,
how God created Man and All things: how Man
fell from God, and of his present Enmity against God,
and the wrath of God against Him until Repentance:
said he, “your words were never out of my heart to
this present;” and said hee “me much pray to Jesus
Christ.” I told him so did many English, French and
Dutch, who had never turned to God, nor loved Him:
He replyed in broken English: “me so big naughty
Heart, me heart all one stone!” Savory expressions
using to breath from compunct and broken Hearts,
and a sence of inward hardnesse and unbrokennesse.
I had many discourses with him in his Life, but this
was the summe of our last parting untill our generall
meeting.</p>

<p>Now because this is the great Inquiry of all men
what Indians have been converted? what have the
English done in those parts? what hopes of the Indians
receiving the knowledge of Christ!</p>

<p>And because to this Question some put an edge
from the boast of the Jesuits in Canada and Maryland,
and especially from the wonderfull conversions
made by the Spaniards and Portugalls in the West-Indies,
besides what I have here written, as also, besides
what I have observed in the Chapter of their
Religion; I shall further present you with a brief additionall
discourse concerning this Great Point, being
comfortably perswaded that that Father of Spirits, who
was graciously pleased to perswade Japhet (the Gen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>tiles)
to dwell in the Tents of Shem (the Jewes) will
in his holy season (I hope approaching) perswade
these Gentiles of America to partake of the mercies
of Europe, and then shall bee fulfilled what is written
by the Prophet Malachi, from the rising of the Sunne
(in Europe) to the going down of the same (in America)
my name shall be great among the Gentiles. So
I desire to hope and pray,</p>

<h2 class="p3 nobreak fs120" id="DIRECTIONS">DIRECTIONS FOR THE USE OF THE
LANGUAGE.</h2>
</div>


<p>1. A dictionary or Grammer way I had consideration
of, but purposely avoided, as not so accommodate
to the benefit of all, as I hope, this forme is.</p>

<p>2. A Dialogue also I had thoughts of, but avoided
for brevities sake, and yet (with no small paines) I
have so framed every Chapter and the matter of it,
as I may call it an implicite Dialogue.</p>

<p>3. It is framed chiefly after the Narrogánset Dialect,
because most Spoken in the Countrey, and yet
(with attending to the variation of peoples and Dialects)
it will be of great use in all parts of the Countrey.</p>

<p>4. Whatever your occasion bee either of Travell,
Discourse, Trading &amp;c. turne to the Table which will
direct you to the Proper Chapter.</p>

<p>5. Because the Life of all Language is in the Pronuntiation,
I have been at the paines and charges to
Cause the Accents, Tones or sounds to be affixed,
(which some understand according to the Greeke Language,
Acutes, Graves, Circumflexes) for example,
in the second Leafe in the word Ewò He: the Sound
or tone must not be put on E, but Wò, where the
grave accent is.</p>

<p>In the same Leafe, in the word <em>Ascowequássin</em>, the
sound must not be on any of the Syllables, but on <em>quáss</em>,
where the Acute or Sharp sound is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>In the same leafe, in the word Anspaumpmaûntam,
the Sound must not be on any other Syllable but
Maûn where the Circumflex or long sounding Accent
is.</p>

<p>6. The <em>English</em> for every <em>Indian</em> word or phrase
stands in a straight line directly against the <em>Indian</em>:
yet sometimes there are two words for the same thing
(for their Language is exceeding copious, and they
have five or six words sometimes for one thing) and
then the English stands against them both; for example
in the second leafe.</p>

<h3><em>Of Salutation.</em>&mdash;Observation.</h3>


<p>The natives are of two sorts (as the English are)
some more rude and clownish, who are not so apt to
salute, but upon salutation resalute lovingly. Others,
and the generall, are sober and grave, and yet cheerfull
in a meane, and as ready to begin a salutation as
to resalute, which yet the English generally begin,
out of desire to civilize them.</p>

<p>What cheare <em>Nétop</em> is the general salutation of all
English toward them. <em>Nétop</em> is friend. <em>Netompaûog</em>,
Friends.</p>

<p>They are exceedingly delighted with Salutations in
their own Language.</p>

<p>I once travailed to an Iland of the wildest in our
parts, where in the night an Indian (as he said) had
a vision or dream of the Sun (whom they worship for
a God) darting a Beame into his Breast which he
conceived to be the Messenger of his Death: This
poore Native call’d his Friends and neighbours, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
prepared some little refreshing for them, but himselfe
was kept waking and Fasting in great Humiliations
and Invocations for 10 dayes and nights: I was
alone (having travailed from my Barke, the wind being
contrary) and little could I speake to them to
their understandings especially because of the change
of their Dialect or manner of Speech from our neighbours:
yet so much (through the help of God) I did
speake, of the <em>True</em> and <em>living only Wise God</em>, of the
Creation: of Man, and his <em>fall</em> from God, &amp;c. that at
parting many burst forth, <em>Oh when will you come
againe, to bring us some more newes of this God?</em></p>


<h3><em>From their Sleeping: The Observation generall.</em></h3>

<p>Sweet rest is not confind to soft Beds, for, not only
God gives his beloved sleep on hard lodgings: but
also Nature and Custome gives sound sleep to these
Americans on the Earth, on a Boord or Mat. Yet
how is <em>Europe</em> bound to God for better lodging, &amp;c.</p>

not stir; I told the <em>father</em> that I would correct my <em>child</em>,
if he should so disobey me, &amp;c. Upon this the father
took up a sticke, the <em>boy</em> another, and flew at his father:
upon my perswasion, the poor <em>father</em> made him smart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>

<p>Nqussútam&mdash;I remove house: Which they doe upon
these occasions: From thick warme vallies, where
they winter, they remove a little neerer to their Summer
fields; when ’tis warme Spring, then they remove
to their fields, where they plant Corne. In middle
of Summer, because of the abundance of Fleas,
which the dust of the house breeds, they will flie and
remove on a sudden from one part of their field to a
fresh place: And sometimes having fields a mile or
two, or many miles asunder, when the worke of one
field is over, they remove house to the other: If
death fall in amongst them, they presently remove
to a fresh place: If an enemie approach they remove
into a Thicket, or Swampe, unlesse they have some
fort to remove unto.</p>

<p>Sometimes they remove to a hunting house in the
end of the yeare, and forsake it not until Snow lie
thick and then will travell home, Men, women and
children, thorow the snow, thirtie, yea, fiftie or sixtie
miles; but their great remove is from their Summer
fields to warme and thicke woodie bottomes where
they winter: They are quicke; in halfe a day, yea,
sometimes at few houres warning to be gone and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>

readie pitcht for their Mats.</p>

<p>I once in travell lodged at a house, at which in my
returne I hoped to have lodged againe the next night,
but the house was gone in that interim, and I was

never saw any so to forget nature it selfe in such excessive
length and monstrous fashion, as to the shame
of the English Nation, I now (with grief) see my

<p>Wuttip, The Braine.&mdash;Obs. In the braine their
opinion is, that the soule (of which we shall speake in
the Chapter of Religion) keeps her chiefe seat and
residence:</p>

<p>For the temper of the braine in quick apprehensions
and accurate judgements (to say no more) the
most high and soveraign God and Creator, hath not
made them inferiour to Europeans.</p>

<p>The Mauquaûogs, or Men-eaters that live two or
three hundred miles West from us, make a delicious
monstrous dish of the head and brains of their enemies;
which yet is no barre (when the time shall approach)
against Gods call and their repentance and who
knowes (but) a greater love to the Lord Jesus? great
sinners forgiven love much.</p>

they follow their arrow, and falling upon the person
wounded and tearing his head a little aside by his

<p>I know the Man yet living, who in time of warre,
pretended to fall from his owne campe to the enemie,
proffered his service in the front with them against
his owne Armie from whence he had revolted. Hee
propounded such plausible advantages, that he drew
them out to battell, himselfe keeping in the front; but
on a sudden, shot their chiefe Leader and Captaine,
and being shot, in a trice fetcht off his head, and returned
immediately to his owne againe, from whom

<p>Obs: Canounicus, the old high Sachim of the

in a solemne oration to myself, in a solemne assembly,
using this word, said, I have never suffered any
wrong to be offered to the English since they landed:
nor never will: he often repeated this word,
Wunnaunewayeán, Englishman; if the Englishman
speake true, if hee meane truly, then shall I goe to
my grave in peace, and hope that the English and
my posteritie shall live in love and peace together.
I replied, that he had no cause (as I hoped) to question
Englishmen’s Wunnaumwaúonck, that is, faithfulnesse,
he having had long experience of their
friendlinesse and trustinesse. He tooke a stick and
broke it into ten pieces, and related ten instances
(laying downe a stick to every instance) which gave
him cause thus to feare and say; I satisfied him in
some presently, and presented the rest to the Governours
of the English, who, I hope, will be far from
giving just cause to have Barbarians to question their
Wunnaumwâuonck, or faithfulnesse.</p>

<p>Obs. It may bee wondred why since <em>New-England</em>
is about 12 degrees neerer to the Sun, yet
some part of Winter, it is there ordinarily more cold
then here in <em>England</em>: the reason is plaine: all Ilands
are warmer then maine Lands and Continents,
England being an Iland, Englands winds are Sea
winds, which are commonly more thick and vapoury,
and warmer winds: the Nor-West wind (which occasioneth
New-England cold) comes over the cold frozen
Land, and over many millions of Loads of Snow: and
yet the pure wholsomenesse of the Aire is wonderfull,
and the warmth of the Sunne, such in the sharpest
weather, that I have often seen the Natives Children
runne about starke naked in the coldest dayes,
and the <em>Indians</em> Men and Women lye by a Fire, in the
Woods in the coldest nights, and I have been often
out myselfe such nights without fire, mercifully and
wonderfully preserved.</p>

the Gods chiefly dwell; and hither the soules of all
their Great and Good Men and women goe.</p>

<p>This Southwest wind is called by the <em>New-English</em>
the sea turne, which comes from the Sunne in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
Morning, about nine or ten of the Clock Southeast,
and about South, and then strongest Southwest in the
after-noone, and towards night, when it dies away.</p>

<p>It is rightly called the Sea turne, because the wind
commonly all the Summer, comes off from the North
and Northwest in the night, and then turnes againe
about from the South in the day: as <em>Solomon</em> speaks
of the vanitie of the Winds in their changes, <em>Eccles.</em>
1. 6.</p>

may the mysticall Fowles, the Divells be well resembled
(and so it pleaseth the Lord Jesus himselfe to
observe <em>Matth.</em> 13.) which mysticall Fowle follow the
sowing of the Word, and picke it up from loose and
carelesse hearers, as these Black-birds follow the
materiall seed.</p>

<p>Against the Birds the <em>Indians</em> are very carefull,
both to set their corne deep enough that it may have
a strong root not so apt to be pluckt up (not too
deep lest they bury it, and it never come up:) as also
they put up little watch-houses in the middle of their
fields, in which they, or their biggest children lodge,
and early in the Morning prevent the Birds, &amp;c.</p>

he made him a little House or shed of the bark
of it, he puts fire and followes the burning of it with
fire, in the midst in many places: his corne he boyles
and hath the Brook by him, and sometimes angles
for a little fish: but so hee continues burning and hewing

<p>Obs: After I had (as farre as my language would
reach) discoursed (upon a time) before the chief Sachim
or Prince of the Countrey, with his arch priests,
and many other in a full assembly; and being night,
wearied with travell and discourse I lay down to rest;
and before I slept I heard this passage: A Qunnihticut
Indian (who had heard our discourse) told the
Sachim Miantunnómu that soules went up to Heaven,
or downe to Hell; For, saith he, our Fathers have
told us, that our soules go to the Southwest. The
Sachim answered, But how doe you know yourselfe,
that your soules goe to the Southwest; did you ever
see a soule goe thither? The Native replied; when did
he (naming my selfe) see a soul goe to Heaven or Hell?
The Sachim againe replied: He hath books and
writings, and one which God himselfe made, concerning
mens soules, and therefore may well know more
than wee that have none, but take all upon trust from
our forefathers.</p>

<p>The said Sachim, and the chiefe of his people, discoursed
by themselves, of keeping the Englishmans
day of worship, which I could easily have brought
the Countrey to, but that I was persuaded, and am,
that Gods way is first to turne a soule from its Idolls,
both of heart, worship and conversation, before it is
capable of worship, to the true and living God, according
to 1. Thes. 1. 9. You turned to God from Idolls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
to serve or worship the living and true God. As
also, that the two first Principles and Foundations of
true religion or Worship of the true God in Christ,
are Repentance from dead workes, and Faith towards
God, before the Doctrine of Baptisme or washing
and the laying on of hands, which containe <ins class="corr" id="tn-118" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the Ordiances'">
the Ordinances</ins> and Practises of worship; the want of which,
I conceive is the bane of million of soules in England,
and all other Nations professing to be Christian
Nations, who are brought by publique authority
to Baptisime and fellowship with God in Ordinances
of worship, before the saving worke of repentance,
and a true turning to God, Heb. 6. 2.</p>

I think God is more gracious to them above other
women, but that it followes, First from the hardnesse
of their constitution, in which respect they beare
their sorrowes the easier. Secondly from their extraordinary
great labour (even above the labour of
men) as in the field, they sustaine the labour of it,
in carrying of mighty Burthens, in digging clammes
and getting other Shelfish from the Sea, in beating
all their Corne in Morters, &amp;c. Most of them count
it a shame for women in Travell to make complaint,
and many of them are scarcely heard to groane. I
have often knowne in one Quarter of an houre a Woman
merry in the House, and delivered and merry
againe, and within two dayes abroad, and after foure

<h3><em>Concerning their Coyne.</em></h3>


<p>The Indians are ignorant of Europes Coyne; yet
they have given a name to ours, and call it Monèash
from the English money.</p>

<p>Their owne is of two sorts; one white, which they
make of the stem or stocke of the Periwincle, which
they call, Meteaûhock, when all the shell is broken
off: and of this sort six of their small Beads (which
they make with holes to string the bracelets) are currant
with the English for a Peny.</p>

<p>The second is black, inclining to blew, which is
made of the shell of a fish, which some English call
Hens, Poquaûhock, and of this sort three make an
English peny.</p>

<p>They that live upon the Sea side generally make
of it, and as many make as will.</p>

<p>The Indians bring downe all their sorts of Furs,
which they take in the countrey, both to the Indians
and to the English for this Indian Money: this Money
the English, French and Dutch, trade to the Indians,
six hundred miles in severall parts (North and
South from New-England) for their Furres, and
whatsoever they stand in need of from them: as
Corne, Venison, &amp;c.</p>

worth of the English but five shillings (sometimes

by the fall of Beaver in England. The Natives
are very impatient, when for English commodities
they pay so much more of their money, and not
understanding the cause of it; and many say the
English cheat and deceive them, though I have laboured

<h3><em>Of their Hunting, &amp;c.</em></h3>


<p>Wee shall not name over the severall sorts of Beasts
which we named in the Chapter of Beasts.</p>

<p>The Natives hunt two wayes: First, when they
pursue their game (especially Deere, which is the
generall and wonderfull plenteous hunting in the
Countrey:) I say, they pursue in twentie, fortie, fiftie
yea, two or three hundred in a company, (as I
have seene) when they drive the woods before them.
Secondly. They hunt by Traps of severall sorts, to
which purpose after they have observed, in spring
time and Summer, the haunt of the Deere, then about
Harvest, they goe ten or twentie together, and sometimes
more, and withall (if it be not too farre) wives
and children also, where they build up little hunting
houses of Barks and Rushes (not comparable to their
dwelling houses) and so each man takes his bounds
of two, three, or foure miles, where he sets thirty, forty
or fiftie Traps, and baits his Traps with that food
the Deere loves, and once in two dayes he walkes
his round to view his Traps.</p>

the Wolfe having glutted himselfe with the one
halfe, leaves the other for his next bait; but the glad
Indian finding of it prevents him.</p>

<p>And that wee may see how true it is, that all wild
creatures, and many tame, prey upon the poore Deere,
(which are there in a right embleme of Gods persecuted,
that is, hunted people, as I observed in the

chased by a Wolfe, at last (as their manner is) after
the chase of ten, it may be more, miles running, the
stout Wolfe tired out the nimble Deere, and seasing
upon it kill’d; In the act of devouring his prey, two
English Swine, big with Pig, past by, assaulted the
Wolfe, drove him from his prey, and devoured so much
of that poore Deere, as they both surfeited and dyed
that night.</p>

<p>The Wolfe is an Embleme of a fierce blood-sucking
persecutor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

sometimes there it lies a day together before the

and other wild Beasts (most commonly the Wolfe)
who seaseth upon the Deere and Robs the Indian
(at his first devouring) of neere halfe his prey, and
if the Indian come not the sooner, hee makes a second
greedie Meale and leaves him nothing but the bones,
and the torn Deereskins, especially if he call some of
his greedy Companions to his bloody banquet.</p>

<p>Upon this, the Indian makes a falling trap called
Sunnúckhig, (with a great weight of stones) and so
sometimes Knocks the Wolfe on the head with a gainefull
revenge, especially if it bee a blacke Wolfe,
whose Skins they greatly prize.</p>

<h3><em>Of their Gaming, &amp;c.</em></h3>


<p>Their games (like the English) are of two sorts,
private and publike; A Game like unto the English
Cards, yet, instead of Cards, they play with strong
Rushes.</p>

<p>Secondly, they have a kinde of Dice which are
Plumb stones painted, which they cast in a Tray with
a mighty noyse and sweating: Their publique Games
are solemnized with the meeting of hundreds; sometimes
thousands, and consist of many vanities, none
of which I durst ever be present at, that I might not
countenance and partake of their folly, after I once
saw the evill of them.</p>

<p>Obs: The chiefe Gamesters amongst them much
desire to make their Gods side with them in their
Games (as our English Gamsters so farre also acknowledge
God) therefore I have seen them keepe as
a precious stone a piece of Thunderbolt, which is
like unto a Chrystall, which they dig out of the ground
under some Tree, Thunder-Smitten, and from this
stone they have an opinion of successe, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
not heard any of these prove loosers, which I conceive
may be Satans policie, and Gods’ holy Justice
to harden them for their not rising higher from the
Thunderbolt, to the God that sends or shoots it.</p>

towne, and two chosen out of the rest by course to
play the Game at this kind of Dice in the midst of all
their abettors, with great shouting and solemnity: beside,
they have great meetings of foot-ball playing,
onely in Summer, towne against towne, upon some
broad sandy shoare, free from stones, or upon some
soft heathie plot because of their naked feet at which
they have great stakings, but seldome quarrell.</p>

<p class="noindent">Cukkúmmote wepe, You steale; as I have often told
them in their gamings, and in their great losings when
they have staked and lost their money, clothes, house,
corne, and themselves (if single persons) they will
confesse it being weary of their lives, and ready to
make away themselves, like many an English Man:
an Embleme of the horrour of conscience, which all
poore sinners walk in at last, when they see what wofull
games they have played in their life, and now
find themselves eternall Beggars.</p>

<p>Keesaqúnnamun, Another kind of solemne, publike
meeting, wherein they lie under the trees, in a kinde
of Religious observation, and have a mixture of Devotions
and sports: But their chiefest Idoll of all for
sport and game, is (if their land be at peace) toward
Harvest, when they set up a long house called Qunnekamuck,
which signifies Long house, sometimes
an hundred sometimes two hundred foot long, upon a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
plaine neere the Court (which they call Kitteickaûick)
where many thousands, men and Women meet,
where he that goes in danceth in the sight of all the rest;
and is prepared with money, coats, small breeches,
Knives, or what hee is able to reach to, and gives
these things away to the Poore, who yet must particularly
beg and say, Cowequetúmmous, that is, I beseech
you: which word, (although there is not one
common beggar amongst them) yet they will often use
when their richest amongst them would fain obtain
ought by gift.</p>


<h3><em>Generall Observations of their Sports.</em></h3>

<p>This life is a short minute, eternitie followes. On
the improvement or disimprovement of his short minute,
depends a joyfull or dreadfull eternity; yet (which
I tremble to thinke of) how cheape is this invaluable
jewell, and how many vaine inventions and foolish
pastimes have the sonnes of men in all parts of the
world found out, to passe time and post over this
short minute of life, untill, like some pleasant River,
they have past into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mare mortuum</i>, the dead sea of
eternall lamentation.</p>

and yet having no Swords nor Guns, all that are

heated it with store of wood, laid upon an heape
of stones in the middle. When they have taken out
the fire, the stones keepe still a great heat: Ten,
twelve, twenty more or lesse, enter at once starke
naked, leaving their Coats, small breeches, (or aprons)
at the doore, with one to keepe all: here doe
they sit round these hot stones an houre or more, taking
tobacco, discoursing and sweating together; which
sweating they use for two ends: First, to cleanse their
skin: Secondly, to purge their bodies, which doubtlesse
is a great meanes of preserving them, and recovering
them from diseases, especially from the French
disease, which by sweating and some potions, they
perfectly and speedily cure: when they come forth
(which is matter of admiration) I have seen them
runne (Summer and Winter) into the brookes to coole
them, without the least hurt.</p>

Priests in these times, the poore people commonly
dye under their hands, for alas, they administer nothing

<p>Wesquaubenan, to wrap up, in winding mats or
coats, as we say winding sheets. Mockkuttauce, One
of chiefest esteeme, who winds up and buries the
dead; commonly some wise, grave, and well descended
man hath that office. When they come to the
Grave, they lay the dead by the Grave’s mouth, and
then all sit downe and lament; that I have seen teares
run down the cheeks of stoutest Captaines, as well as
little children in abundance; and after the dead is
laid in Grave, and sometimes (in some parts) some
goods cast in with them, they have then a second
lamentation, and upon the Grave is spread the
Mat that the party died on, the Dish he eat in, and
sometimes a faire Coat of skin hung upon the next
tree to the Grave, which none will touch, but suffer
it there to rot with the Dead: Yea I saw with mine
owne eyes that at my late comming forth of the Coun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>trey,
the chiefe and most aged peaceable Father of
the Countrey, Caunoûnicus, having buried his Sonne,
he burned his own Palace, and all his goods in it
(amongst them to a great value) in a solemne remembrance
of his sonne and in a kind of humble Expiation
to the Gods, who (as they believe) had taken
his sonne from him.</p>


<h3><em>The Generall Observation of their Dead.</em></h3>

<p>O, how terrible is the looke the speedy and serious
thought of Death to all the Sons of Men? Thrice
happy those who are dead and risen with the Sonne
of God, for they are past from Death to life, and shall
not see Death (a heavenly sweet Paradox or Ridle,)
as the Son of God hath promised them.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
